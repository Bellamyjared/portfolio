bug ~~~~~ if you have scroll lock on and click on a character if your holding down you can make the character go super fast

technology icons have their lower halfs unable to register mouse over to change title

need to add scroll effect
need to add descriptions
need to add github links to projects
need to add model in about

if the screen is to small then the scroll doesnt go all the way to the bottom, need to add extra hieght
